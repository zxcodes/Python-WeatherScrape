5. Web broswer of your choice and its driver (Firefox / Microsoft Edge / Chrome).
# Browser Used:
* Microsoft Edge.
# Key points:
* You can use any browser as long as it has a web driver and supports selenium.
* If you're running this directly, make sure you're on the latest version of Microsoft Edge and has its web driver installed.
* In that case, just replace the below path with yours and you're good to go.

```
   path = r'C:\Users\farma\Downloads\edgedriver\msedgedriver.exe'
```
   
* If you're using Chrome or any other browser, check how it's implemented and modify the code accordingly.
* BeautifulSoup library can also be used instead of Gazpacho.
* Also make sure you've installed everything that's mentioned in the requirements. Else it ain't gonna work.
